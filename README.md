# Assignment 3 – Student Record Management Using Dictionary (C#)

## Problem Statement
Create a C# program that stores student records using a dictionary.  
Each student has:
- ID (integer, unique)
- Name (string)

The program should allow the user to:
1. Add a new student
2. Remove a student by ID
3. Display all student records

---

## Description
This console application demonstrates the use of the `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` collection in C#.  
Student records are stored using the student ID as the key and the student name as the value.

The program uses a menu-driven approach to allow users to interactively add, remove, and display student records.

---

## Features
- Menu-driven console interface
- Uses `Dictionary<int, string>` for data storage
- Prevents duplicate student IDs
- Allows removal of students by ID
- Displays all stored student records
- Input validation using `TryParse`

---

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Framework
- Collections (`Dictionary`)
- Console Application
- Visual Studio

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio
3. Run the application
4. Choose options from the menu:
   - Add Student
   - Remove Student
   - Display Students
   - Exit
